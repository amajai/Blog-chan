        <h2>To-Fruit or Not-To-Fruit</h2>
        <p>Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular, have propagated
          with the
          movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition; in
          fact,
          humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. Accordingly, fruits account
          for a
          substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate)
          have acquired
          extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.</p>

        <h2>Hayao Miyazaki Greatness!</h2>
        <p>Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature
          and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and
          craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his
          films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists
          with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of
          Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary
          Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014. In 2002, American film critic Roger Ebert
          suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history, praising the depth and artistry of
          his films.</p>

        <h2>Unity and Integrity</h2>
        <p>National unity and integrity are essential to promote a country. The title name may appear similar with the
          saying
          'where there is a will, there is a way'. We may call it a parody of the proverb or the saying. Whatever it is
          termed,
          my aim is to convey the message as to how integrity and unity are contributing in a combined manner to the
          nation. It
          is significantly stated that, both unity national integration play a vital role for solid foundation of
          nationalism,
          secularism, socialism and democracy. National integrity is part and parcel of modernization. The other name
          of national
          integration is also political integration.</p>

        <h2>Eye Sea U</h2>
        <p>A wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi and animals, live in the
          sea, which
          offers a wide range of marine habitats and ecosystems, ranging vertically from the sunlit surface waters and
          the
          shoreline to the enormous depths and pressures of the cold, dark abyssal zone, and in latitude from the cold
          waters
          under the Arctic ice to the colourful diversity of coral reefs in tropical regions. Many of the major groups
          of
          organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started there.</p>
